Thanks for sharing the detailed kubectl describe servicemonitor output.

🔍 Here's what I can confirm from it:
✅ You have 3 endpoints configured for the Kubelet scrape:

/metrics (default)

/metrics/cadvisor

/metrics/probes

❌ No metricRelabelings for kubelet_volume_stats_* on the default /metrics endpoint — that’s the one where volume stats are exposed.

❌ All metricRelabelings currently apply only to /metrics/cadvisor, and they’re all action: drop.

🔧 Why volume metrics are missing
The kubelet_volume_stats_* metrics (like kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes, used_bytes, etc.) come from the /metrics endpoint.

Because your /metrics endpoint has no metricRelabelings, and the default chart doesn’t retain those metrics unless explicitly told to — they’re being excluded.
